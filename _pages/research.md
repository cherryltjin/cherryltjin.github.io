with <a href="https://web.suda.edu.cn/dwsxy/001_30503/list.psp" target="_blank">Conggang Li</a> and <a href="https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/JiataoLiu" target="_blank">Jiatao Liu</a> \
**Abstract**: This project investigates the relationship between corporate data security awareness and debt capital costs, using data from A-share listed companies in China from 2016 to 2023. The findings indicate that companies with stronger data security awareness tend to benefit from lower borrowing costs due to reduced operational, litigation, and reputational risks. This study employs traditional machine learning tools, including dictionary-based text analysis and Word2Vec, supplemented by GPT-based predictions to reinforce the results.

**Paying for Safety: Major Accidents and Auditor Pricing** \
with <a href="http://sf.ruc.edu.cn/jszy/xr/" target="_blank">Rong Xu</a> and Yanyin Li \
**Abstract**: This study analyzes the impact of major safety incidents on audit pricing, using data from China between 2008 and 2022. It finds that auditors increase fees for companies in regions affected by catastrophic events due to heightened risk perceptions. Geographic proximity and the recency of incidents significantly influence audit pricing, with auditorsâ€™ expertise in safety-related fields further affecting their risk assessments.

**Abstract**: This study utilizes data from 2008 to 2022 to mitigate the influence of a major earthquake and investigates the impact of significant accidents on corporate workforce structures. The findings reveal that, following a major accident, companies typically reduce the number and proportion of low-skilled employees while increasing investments in artificial intelligence. Notably, the effects of these shocks are long-lasting, as labor investment efficiency significantly improves within one to three years after such incidents.
